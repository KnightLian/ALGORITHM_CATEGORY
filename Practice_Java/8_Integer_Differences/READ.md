You are given a list (n <= 100) of positive integers (value <= 500), your program divides these integers into two groups, such that the difference between the sums of these two groups is minimized.   

Example 1:  
Input: 1 1 1 2 2  
Output: (1 1 1)(2 2) => 1 (difference between 3 and 4)  

Example 2:  
Input: 1 2 4 6  
Output: (1 6)(2 4) => 1  (difference between 7 and 6)  

Example 3:  
Input: 3 9 2 3 5  
Output: (3 3 5)(9 2) => 0  (sums are equal)    

Please briefly describe your logic/algorithm.  
Note that your program code should be well-documented and self-explained.  
Please also submit your test cases for proving the correctness of your program.
