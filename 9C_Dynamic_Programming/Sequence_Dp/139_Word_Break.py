'''
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, 
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:
The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Â             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
             
Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

        f[0] = True
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            for i in range(j):
                word = s[i:j]
                # print(word)
                if word in wordDict and f[i] == True:
                    f[j] = True
        # print(f)
        return f[-1]
