Given n distinct positive integers, integer k (k <= n) and a number target.
Find k numbers where sum is target. Calculate how many solutions there are?

Example 1
Input:
List = [1,2,3,4]
k = 2
target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 + 4 = 2 + 3 = 5
Example 2

Input:
List = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 3
target = 6
Output: 1
