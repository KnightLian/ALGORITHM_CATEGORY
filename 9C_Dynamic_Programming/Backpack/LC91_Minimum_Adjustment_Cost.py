'''
Given an integer array, 
adjust each integers so that the difference of every adjacent integers are not greater than a given number target.
If the array before adjustment is A, 
the array after adjustment is B, you should minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]|

-You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and not greater than 100.

Example 1:
	Input:  [1,4,2,3], target=1
	Output:  2

Example 2:
	Input:  [3,5,4,7], target=2
	Output:  1
